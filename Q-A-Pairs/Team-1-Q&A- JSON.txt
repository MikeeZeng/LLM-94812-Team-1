{"input": " The important issues in the field of global data access, sharing, and governance include which global topics?", "output": " Access to and sharing of data are critical to enable AI’s benefits across sectors. Policies must encourage data access and sharing while addressing associated risks, for countries to harness the full potential. In many countries, policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and common ground in discussions, cooperation, and coordination on data governance, at national and international levels. They focus on aspects relevant to their policy domains and jurisdiction. Therefore, data should be governed to maximize its benefits while addressing risks and challenges, including protecting the rights of individuals and organizations. This requires comprehensive policy to address cross-cutting challenges while accounting for the specificities of data governance in domains like trade or competition (OECD, forthcoming[19]). These include:
First, Balancing the trade-offs between data openness and control. The more openly data is accessed, shared, and re-used (for example, with open data), the higher its potential social and economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks. Second, Addressing potentially conflicting interests and regulations. Data collected and used to inform AI systems are often (co-)created by the interaction of many stakeholders in the global data ecosystem, in some cases without them being aware. Facilitating data access and sharing for AI requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data-governance frameworks. Third, Aligning incentives for investment in data and its reuse. While the marginal costs of transmitting, copying, and processing data can be close to zero, substantial investment is often required to generate and collect data and enable data sharing and reuse for AI. Fair distribution of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.”},


{"input": " What are the investment projects in AI research and development in various countries?", "output": " Countries are funding national AI-related research institutes and projects through grants; consolidating AI research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritizing AI investments in specific sectors; pursuing AI-related mission-oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI systems for the public sector. Budgets for AI R&D vary across countries. Since 2020, the United States has dedicated USD 1 billion or more annually to non-defense AI R&D and created national AI research institutes. The EU Horizon 2020 program committed EUR 1.5 billion to AI research over two years and expected an additional EUR 20 billion in 2020 
from the private sector and member states, with the Horizon Europe program continuing these efforts.”},

{"input": " What aspects should be focused on in the hardware field for the development of AI?", "output": " First, It includes using Machine learning models and techniques to learn in an automated manner through patterns and inferences rather than explicit instructions from a human. Second, Connectivity allows the transfer of large volumes of data in real or quasi-real time, while computing infrastructure (hardware and software) executes the mathematical operations needed to calibrate or "train" an AI system and infer its results. The combination of high-quality connectivity, data, computing infrastructure, and AI technologies continues to enable innovative and disruptive new services.”}

How can we ensure that social and cultural stereotypes are not replicated in AI programming, notably when it comes to gender discrimination? Can these circuits be duplicated? Can values be programmed, and by whom? How can we ensure accountability when decisions and actions are fully automated? How do we make sure that no one—wherever they are in the world—is deprived of the benefits of these technologies? How do we ensure that AI is developed in a transparent way, so that global citizens, whose lives it affects, have a say in its development?”},


{"input": " What role does UNESCO play in promoting global dialogue on AI?", "output": " First, UNESCO will be a full and active participant in this global conversation. The organization has many years of experience in the ethics of science and technology. Its advisory bodies have already produced numerous reports and declarations, including on robotics, such as the Report of the World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific Knowledge and Technology on Robotics Ethics in 2017. The advisory bodies also have experience in developing normative instruments, including the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights in 1997 and the Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights in 2005. Second, UNESCO ensures that Africa fully participates in transformations related to AI, not only as a beneficiary but also upstream, contributing directly to its development. In terms of gender equality, UNESCO fights against the biases in the societies to guarantee that they are not reproduced in AI applications. Finally, UNESCO empowers young people by providing them with the skills they need for life in the twenty-first century for integration in a changing labor market. Third, UNESCO also has a key role to play in bridging existing divides, which AI is likely to deepen. Eliminating fragmentation between countries and genders, but also in terms of resources and knowledge, could enable more people to contribute to the digital transformation underway. What's more, UNESCO, with its humanist mission and international dimension, involving researchers, philosophers, programmers, policymakers, and private sector and civil society representatives, is the natural home for debate on such ethical issues. Last but not least, UNESCO is performing its role to the fullest, informing the global debate on the major transformations of its time while establishing principles to ensure that technological advances are used to serve the common good. The promise of AI and its underlying ethical issues are fascinating, and UNESCO's responses to these challenges will transform the world as UNESCO knows it.”},

{"input": " How do you view the idea of artificial intelligence replacing humans?", "output": " I do not agree with it. AI is humanity's new frontier. Once this boundary is crossed, AI will lead to a new form of human civilization. The guiding principle of AI is not to become autonomous or replace human intelligence. Therefore, we must ensure that it is developed through a humanist approach, based on values and human rights. We are faced with a crucial question: what kind of society do we want for tomorrow? The AI revolution opens up exciting new prospects, but the anthropological and social upheaval it brings in its wake warrants careful consideration.”},


{"input": " What overall role does artificial intelligence play in promoting sustainable development?", "output": " AI could open up tremendous opportunities for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its applications enable innovative solutions, improved risk assessment, better planning, and faster knowledge sharing.”}
